##Project description

An online portfolio that demonstrates my interests and the skills I have learned during my fellowship. Ideally, the portfolio would allow access to the posters I have created for DH events, my blog posts and maybe the Future of the Library video? I want to have descriptions of my tasks/projects.  

##Project goals
I would like to have something I can link to on job application. I would like the portfolio to look customized and clean, like Mackenzie's personal site.  


##Progress
Need to organize stuff currently published on Wordpress site.
