# Introductions
My name is Sam Joseph.
I'm a sophomore at Washington & Lee University, working on the "Florence As It Was" *Digital Humanities* project. The goal of the project is to produce a VR rendering of Renaissance Florence contextualized by artworks in situ and didatic excerpts. My job is largely focused on 3D modeling buildings in *Cinema 4D*, but I also  work on Latin translations and designed the project logo:
![Florence As It Was](https://github.com/wludh/ugfellows/blob/master/Joseph/Palazzo-Vecchio-without-expulsion.png)
Currently I am working on simple 3D models to produce a broad map of Early Republican Florence. To create the 3D models:
1. I start in *Adobe Illustrator* with a given map of Early Republican Florence.
..*Select a single building and the border of the given map and copy the building-border pair.
..*Create a new file, paste the building-border pair, and drag the new file into *Cinema 4D*.
2. In *Cinema 4D*, I start with a spline of the buidling-border pair.
..*I redefine its position so the it lies flat with the border corner beginning on the origin of the z axis.
..*Delete the border points.
..*Change the spline type from Bezier to Linear.
..*Parent the spline to an extrude function.
..*Copy the extruded file and paste it into a master file where the other 3D models are also placed.

It's as easy as that. You work on a single building at a time with a border to work with a standard position and extrude.
**BUT**
That's not to say I don't run into issues. *Cinema 4D* crashes with more than three files running and the work takes time, time that I don't always have when balancing my school work.
