# HTML + CSS 

## What is HTML?

Hypertext Markup Language. HTML is a building block of the web. HTML creates the structure behind every website you see. Each webpage is a document that contains the type of elements you'd expect from any document: a title, the text body, paragraphs, lists, header or footer.

When you write a document, you rely on style to indicate something about the text. You might put the title in a bigger font or break up paragraphs with tabs or new lines. Markup languages do this by adding tags around the content you wish to set apart. For example: <title>The Lord of the Rings</title> or <p>This is a whole paragraph.</p> Your human eyes and brain can infer things based on visual appear that computers need to be told explicitly. That's why we need semantic markup.

You can see the HTML for any page on the web by right clicking anywhere on the page and selecting "view page source."

HTML documents are just plain text documents. You can write and read HTML in a text editor like Notepad++ or Sublime. The magic happens when you open an HTML document in the browser. 

Here's a basic HTML document:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Mackenzie's Awesome Webpage!</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>Mackenzie's Awesome Webpage!</h1>
<p>Welcome to my awesome webpage.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

## What is CSS? 

Our next building block of the web is CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets. HTML structures your webpage, but you need something else to add the pretty colors and images. The beauty of CSS is that you can keep all your styles in one stylesheet which you link to all your HTML pages. 

CSS has a different syntax than HTML. First you identify the HTML tag, then you declare the styles you wish to apply. 

```
h1 {color: red;}
```
