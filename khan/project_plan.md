## Project description
I'm working on a website that will include a feature that will allow me to present four versions of a manuscript side by side in their own "panels". I also want to include functionality that allows anyone who visits the website to select a sentence or passage in one panel and have the rest of the panels scroll to the matching part of the selected text in the other manuscripts if the passage is present. 
 
I want to make it possible for multiple versions of a text to be closely examined and analyzed simultaneously, with notes and supplementary materials if possible. This will let anyone working with different versions of manuscripts or translations to seamlessly transition between passages without dealing with multiple windows or copies of texts.

I need to get to a point where my website/plug-in is functional enough for me to use in writing my honors thesis.

## Project goals
* What do want to accomplish with this project? 
  * I want to be able to use it alongside my honors thesis so I can analyze text quickly and efficiently.
* What does the final product look like? 
  * See [Huon d'Auvergne hell scene comparison](http://huondauvergne.org/hell_scene.html "Huon d'Auvergne"). Something like this but with much more text per panel and scrolling functionality.
* What skills do you want to develop? What technology/methodology do you want to use?
  * Coding complex elements for a website using HTML, CSS, JS, and Ruby. Versioning Machine is the framework that should help set this all up.

## Progress
* What have you done so far? 
  * Learned basics of Ruby, in the process of learning JS. 
  * Conducted research on scrolling methods using JS in websites similar to Versioning Machine.
* What do you need to do? 
  * Code
  * Figure out what to code
  * More code
* Can you order/rank your next steps? 
  1. Finish learning basics of JS.
  2. Begin coding framework for VM plug-in. 
  3. Develop container to code framework into a webpage.
  4. Test with other text examples.
  5. Test with Huon d'Auvergne manuscripts.
