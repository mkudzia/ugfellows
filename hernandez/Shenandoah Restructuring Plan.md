# Shenandoah Restructuring Plan
### Website
Color and page constraints play important roles, but this is largely dependent on the website’s purpose. So if we think about the function of Shenandoah, its ultimate goal is to disseminate literature. Then the question becomes, how can we better facilitate the site’s engagement with literature and increase readership?

One of the few things that come to mind is to make the site page better mimic the page of a print magazine. This means using less dark colors and incorporating more blank, or white space.

In particular, I would eliminate the colored background behind the text column and expand the banner image so that it reaches to the ends of the webpage. It creates the impression of vastness and the minimalism accounts for less confusion.

I would also create a clear division between the end of the published piece and the comments section, or even add an expandable comments section, meaning that comments would remain hidden unless the reader chooses to expand them. To increase outreach, many websites have incorporated features that allows for social media sharing. Yet, on the Shenandoah site, many of these features remain hidden. I’d bring these to the forefront while also increasing Shenandoah’s social media presence on Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram.

Another feature of the website to consider is the homepage.

As it stands, the current Shenandoah homepage is a little busy. I would consider following the example of Farleigh Dickinson University's *The Literary Review* and simplifying the homepage down to a single entity.

On *TLR*'s homepage, the only elements with which you are allowed to engage are a piece of literature contained within the latest issue and a sticky navigation bar. As the viewer scrolls toward the bottom of the page, another navigation bar appears, which allows the reader to further engage with the published issue and ecourages them to subscribe to the website.

I suggest borrowing this design for several reasons. (1) the simplicity of the design prevents the site visitor from becoming overwhelmed, (2) highlighting subscription and other potential social media features encourages repeat visits, and (3) it appeals to visitors who stumble across the page because they seek to submit or they seek to read, since in order to determine if a literary magazine is the right fit for your work, you must analyze past publications.

In order to begin the restructuring process of the magazine and its relationship to W&L, we need to start at the website level. We need to bring Shenandoah from the early 2000s, to 2017. That means looking at our contemporaries and borrowing what we like and modifying what we don't. Two well put together online magazines that I recommend studying are:
1. [Fairy Tale Review](https://fairytalereview.com/ "FTR")
2. [Found Poetry Review](http://www.foundpoetryreview.com/ "FPR")

Both embrace a minimalist design principles and model themselves after popular social media sites like Twitter that embrace simplicity. Moreover, they allow for immediate interaction between the user and the webpage through rollover techniques and other hypermedia content.

Aesthetically, these are just a few changes we can make. All should work to establish a coherent identity for Shenandoah. We need to consider what we want our website to say about W&L, about literature, why our magazine is important, and what we have to offer. Any changes we make are likely to bring in more visitors and by using Google analytics, we can determine what is successful, what needs work, and what we should bring further into the spotlight or perhaps drop all together.

### Other ideas
While rebranding the website is probably the most important step to take, we should also consider refining and increasing the services the website has to offer.
+ Like *The Missouri Review*, we can offer audio services, which would appeal to our regular readers while also drawing in those who may be visually impaired.
+ We can increase user/website engagement by offering weekly writing prompts, which could also be implemented in creative writing classes on campus while also encouraging readership.
+ We can craft digital chapbooks or pair with campus activities organizations to coordinate author interviews to be housed online.
+ We can construct a digital archive of past issues, a project that could potentially be funded through the SRS program.
